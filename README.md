# Hello all!
I am an undergraduate student, majoring in Mathematics at Universitas Gadjah Mada. I am also a cohort at Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 1, an independent study program led by Google, supported by GoTo and Traveloka.

I love to work with data. I am eager to pursue my career to become a data analyst, data scientist, or machine learning. I have strong foundation at using data analyst tools such as Python, Spreadsheets, and SQL along with machine learning tools such as TensorFlow and Keras. I always improve my communication skills as I have become master of ceremony at several events. I also love to work with details and structured projects.
